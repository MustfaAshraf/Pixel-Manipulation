# Pixel Manipulation Algorithm

Welcome to the Pixel Manipulation Algorithm project! This repository contains a Python implementation for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques with the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and NumPy.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to manipulate pixels in images to achieve encryption and decryption. It provides two main functions: `encrypt_image` and `decrypt_image`, which utilize the PIL library to read, process, and save images as NumPy arrays. The encryption process involves applying bitwise XOR operations with a user-defined key to each pixel value, ensuring secure transformation of image data.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt images by XORing each pixel with a specified key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted images using the same key to restore the original image.
- **Flexible**: Works with various image formats supported by PIL (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

## Algorithm Details

### Encryption

The `encrypt_image` function:
1. Loads an image from the specified path using PIL.
2. Converts the image to a NumPy array for efficient pixel-level operations.
3. Applies a bitwise XOR operation with the encryption key to each pixel value.
4. Converts the modified NumPy array back to an image and saves it as 'encrypted_image.png'.

### Decryption

The `decrypt_image` function:
1. Opens the encrypted image file using PIL.
2. Converts the image to a NumPy array.
3. Applies a bitwise XOR operation with the same key used for encryption to restore each pixel value.
4. Saves the decrypted image as 'decrypted_image.png'.

## Usage

To encrypt and decrypt images:
1. Run the `pixel_manipulation.py` script.
2. Enter the path of the image file to be encrypted.
3. Provide an encryption key (an integer).
4. The program will output the encrypted image as 'encrypted_image.png' and subsequently decrypt it to 'decrypted_image.png'.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the path of the image file: example_image.png
Enter the encryption key (an integer): 12345

Image encrypted and saved as 'encrypted_image.png'.
Image decrypted and saved as 'decrypted_image.png'.
```
